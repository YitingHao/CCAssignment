/*  
 * Explanation: Since each time you put a dominos on the chessboard, the dominos will cover one black and one 
 * white cell. Therefore, the total number of white cells and black cells should be same if you want to use
 * dominos to cover all the chessboard. However, in this case, you remove two diagonally opposite corners, which
 * have the same colors. Therefore, on the chessboard right now, there are 30 black cells and 32 white cells or
 * 32 black and 30 white. Neither way will give you the same cell number for both colors. Therefore, we can
 * not fill the chessboard in this case.
